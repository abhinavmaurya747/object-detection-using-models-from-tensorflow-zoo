######## Image Object Detection Using Tensorflow-trained Classifier #########
#
# Authors: Abhinav Maurya
# Date: 31/03/2020
# Description: 
# This program uses a TensorFlow-trained neural network to perform object detection.
# It loads the classifier and uses it to perform object detection on an image.
# It draws boxes, scores, and labels around the objects of interest in the image.

## Some of the code is copied from Google's example at
## https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/object_detection_tutorial.ipynb

## and some is copied from Dat Tran's example at
## https://github.com/datitran/object_detector_app/blob/master/object_detection_app.py

## but I changed it to make it more understandable to me.
